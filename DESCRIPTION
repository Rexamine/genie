Description: The Genie algorithm links two clusters in such a way that a chosen
    economic inequity measure (e.g., the Gini index) of the cluster
    sizes does not increase drastically above a given threshold.
    This method most often outperforms the Ward or average linkage in terms of
    the clustering quality on benchmark data. At the same time,
    Genie retains the high speed of the single linkage approach,
    therefore it is also suitable for analysing larger data sets.
